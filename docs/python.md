# Python library

A `.dida` file is an ordinary SQLite database. The companion library
[**pydidascalie**](https://github.com/ClementPla/pydidascalie) reads and writes it
directly. The application does not need to be running.

## Installing

It is not published on PyPI. Install from the repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ClementPla/pydidascalie.git
```

Requires `numpy` and `Pillow`, plus `pyzmq` and `msgpack` if you use the
[Python functions bridge](guide/python-functions.md).

## Creating a project

```python
from didascalie import DidascalieProject, Label

with DidascalieProject.create("dataset.dida", name="My Dataset") as project:
    project.add_label(Label(name="lesion", color="#FF0000"))
    project.import_folder("/path/to/images")
```

## What it is for

**Pre-populating a project from a model.** Run your own model over a folder and
write the predictions into a `.dida` file. Annotators then correct a draft, which
is usually much faster than annotating a blank image.

**Bulk import.** Load a folder of images, optionally with existing masks, without
going through the UI.

**Reading results.** Iterate over frames, labels and masks for training or
analysis.

**Format conversion.** To and from COCO and YOLO.

## Files and formats

`import_folder` takes files the way the application does: by extension first
(`extensions=`, or the project's formats), then by `pattern`. It reads PNG,
JPEG, BMP and TIFF images. Videos and microscopy files are skipped: import them
from the application, then read the project from Python.

`get_frame_image` returns a frame as the application shows it, 8-bit RGB. For a
16-bit or multi-channel frame, such as a converted microscopy file,
`raw=True` returns its own values instead, as a `(height, width, channels)`
array of `uint8`, `uint16` or `float32`:

```python
with DidascalieProject("cells.dida") as project:
    values = project.get_frame_image(frame_id, raw=True)
    print(values.dtype, values.shape)   # uint16 (1024, 1024, 3)
```

## Accounts

A project the library creates has no [accounts](guide/multi-user.md). The
application adds one administrator account the first time it opens the file, and
that account owns everything the library wrote.

On a project that has accounts, the library reads and writes the annotations of
one account at a time: the first administrator by default, or the one you name.

```python
from didascalie import DidascalieProject

with DidascalieProject("study.dida", user="First observer") as project:
    print([u.name for u in project.get_users()])
    project.set_user("Second observer")   # switch account
```

`enable_user_accounts()` gives accounts to a project without them, as the
application does, and `add_user()` adds one. This is how to keep a model's
predictions next to the annotators' work instead of over it:

```python
with DidascalieProject("study.dida") as project:
    project.add_user("unet-v2")
    project.set_user("unet-v2")
    project.add_annotation(frame_id, label_id, mask)
```

The model then appears as one more grader on the
[inter-grader agreement](guide/multi-user.md) page, where it is compared with the
annotators or with another model.

## The round trip

These uses combine into a loop: write predictions from Python, correct them in the
application, read the corrected labels from Python, retrain, and start again. No
server is involved. The project file is all that moves between steps.
